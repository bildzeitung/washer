# washer
Java Websocket broker for Spigot MC

This project eventually aims to expose the Spigot API via WebSocket.

## Requirements
This project uses:
* Gradle 5 (https://gradle.org/)
* Tyrus (https://tyrus-project.github.io/)
* Spigot (https://www.spigotmc.org/)

## Running
TBD, but mostly: put the washer.jar into one directory, its dependencies in another, and adjust the spigot startup classpath
